                            <p>       Human activities are creating a huge amount of waste
                                materials that need to be recycled or reused. We have to stop this or else there
                                won&#39;t be any place for us to live any longer.</p><br>

                              <br><p>  We can no longer think that others will find a solution to this problem. Instead, we
                              must also accept our responsibilities and do the little steps that are required to
                              make this world more wonderful. I&#39;m saying this because the consistent small steps
                              will impact a lot in anything you do. </p>

                            <br> <h3> <b>1. Bring a reusable bag to grocery shops. </b></h3> <p> You have to reuse the bag that you have instead of just throwing it
                                after using it once. Therefore most of the grocery shops increased the price of the
                                bags to force the customers to bring their own bags. </p> <br> <h3> 2. Make sure the waste you throw away goes to the right place.</h3><p>You need to dispose of the waste materials into the necessary
                                    trash bins. For example, you have to put the plastic waste into the correct bin that
                                    has written &quot;Plastic Waste Bin&quot;.</p> <br> <h3> 3. Don&#39;t buy single-use items.</h3><p> Try to buy items that can use several times. It is good for both,
                                        you and the environment.</p> <br> <h3> 4. Compost it.</h3><p> The process of composting changes natural waste into valuable
                                            fertilizer. 25% of the items in your waste could be separated from the waste you
                                            throw away and composted in your home. Try it out.</p> <br>

                                <br> <h3> 1. You can save your money.</h3><p> By reducing the waste we disposed of, (reusing them) we can save
                                    the money that will spend to buy a new one.</p> <br> <h3> 2. Decrease Global Warming.</h3> <p> About 6%-8% of all human-caused greenhouse gas emanations could
                                        be decreased if we reduce the waste materials we throw away.</p> <br> <h3>3. Saving energy</h3> <p> Making products from recycled supplies wants less energy than
                                            producing them from new materials. Sometimes it&#39;s an immense difference in
                                            energy.</p><br> 

                                            <p> The fact is, we all need to get into the way of using less stuff first of all. And
                                                the items we do use ought to be reused before being recycled, to minimize
                                                the waste we disposed of. This would be a significant boost to the global
                                                waste management challenge.</p>
