                          <p> In the present, there are some massive arguments between two sides that one side believes tourism is good for local area and the other side believes it is not good.</p>
                          <br> <p> One of the biggest argument is, does tourism have various effects on the social and cultural aspects of life in a particular region.
                               According to me it does. The reason I am saying that because the local people may copy the lifestyles of tourists that visit their regions, 
                               and the result of that could be the loss of traditions that they lived accordingly for years. And also some people may enter into criminal activities to fetch money from tourists,
                                leading to rising crimes and anti-social activities. This is effecting social aspects massively. </p>

                              <br>
                              <p> There is another argument among people to clarify whether travel industry's impact on the world and country economics? Yes it does impact on the world and countries economy. 
                                  But as a coin has two sides that called head and tails, this argument also have positive and negative side. The negative side is, there may be damage to the natural flora and fauna. 
                                  With a huge number of people in the area, more natural resources may require, which leads to a shortage of natural resources. Tourism often puts pressure on natural resources through over-consumption, 
                                  often in places where resources are already short. <br> <br> The problem is each and every country need tourism to avoid economic crisis. But because of some tourist natural heritages, rivers, oceans are getting destroyed day by day. 
                                  <br><br>To overcome this problem we should follow eco-tourism concept. Simply ecotourism means, a tourism that centers on awareness of the environment and the local community. It is very important protect our tourists attractions. If we won’t
                                   able to do so, our future generations will miss the amazing opportunity to experience the beauty of those places. <br>
